A new Flutter project.

## GitHub code spaces not working with Firebase Flutter  Web app

I would like to login into a codespace for my app (https://github.com/sachavieuxroy/firebasecodespaceflutterdemo) on gitHub codespaces using google chrome. Then using the vscode ide running in the browser, I would like to keep working on my app from anywhere, if I have access to an internet connection and a chrome web browser. 


Note: GitHub codespaces seems to have some problems with running my application on Android that it does not have on a desktop computer.

I used this line in the command prompt to run my app on Android :
flutter run  -d web-server --web-hostname=0.0.0.0 --web-port=3000

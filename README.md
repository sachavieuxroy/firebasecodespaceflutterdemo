# firebasecodespaceflutterdemo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Note: GitHub codespaces seems to have some problems with running my application on Android that it does not have on a desktop computer.

I used the line in the command prompt to run my app on Android :
flutter run  -d web-server --web-hostname=0.0.0.0 --web-port=3000

[Here is a link to a video of me creating/using a github codespace for this application :] (https://go.sachavieuxroy.com/firebasecodespaceflutterdemo)
